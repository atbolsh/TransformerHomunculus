After it's decent at the autoencoder, I will teach several tricks:
 -- identify the corners, 
 -- predict position before / after a motion,
 -- imagine something where it isn't
 -- draw lines from agent to various targets
 -- follow drawn lines,
 -- correctly describe objects and their relative positions.

This part is relatively straightforward. The next two require creativity.


From there I will set it up in some way to combine these, make plans, draw visual 'helpers', then execute on these plans.
THis will probably involve 'canvases' and 'plan documents'; it will learn when to pull something into its memory.

From there, I will teach it to 'cut corners'; learn to skip steps, constructing its own data (using System 2) 
and then setting up a training routine for System 1.
 -- at this stage, concepts like 'plan', 'imagine', 'solve', 'skill', etc can be introduced.
 -- I can teach it how to quickly become familiar with some entirely new element added to the game, some entirely new object.
 -- once this has been perfected, I think I can get very close to self-awareness and conscious curiousity.

I think I can get all of that out of the game. Optimistically, this is a few months' work. After this, I will be ready for robotics or 3d envs.
