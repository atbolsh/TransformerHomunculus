This is the repo that is going to become AGI, or at least the first repo that is seriously going to be trained on cognitive tasks using my game.

I started clean, copying over only what I needed from the Florence repo: the game, the code for the agent, and some code for RL.

That last is the messiest, and won't be needed the longest. It's also the only one where I kept the demonstration ipynb notebooks, since 
in that case, they still encode some crucial RL algorithm information.

I had meant to make this on the penguins.army server, but I have technical difficulties with it, so I am sticking with penguins.farm while I fix those.

For a demonstration of the code (in case I forget and haven't made .ipynb's for training in the main space of this folder), look to the Florence repo.

Next task: pretraining, especially on images. I need to see the capacity of the image transformer autoencoder I have chosen. This can be done on the smaller
penguins.farm server.
