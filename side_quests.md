Competes with training:
 -- debug why big server crashes with 2 training notebooks
 -- move all docs into new doc folder
 -- move all frameworks into new frameworks folder and make them work.

Independent of training:
 -- move everything important into new clearn git repo
 -- make proper 'framework' folder
 -- read up on SOTA
 -- try a framework or two (inference or training) on a new architecture, downloaded / pretrained
 -- try different training mechanisms for the frameworks. Check speeds and price
    -- check prices again, then maybe buy some top-of-the-line servers and swallow cost
 -- look up simple 3d envs. Try writing for one?
 -- look up lego robots and AI for lego robots (or other small robot platforms). Start building an env / machine? Play with simulators.
    -- focus on systems with prebuilt simulators / pretraining mechanisms
 -- business plans (see business_plans.md)
