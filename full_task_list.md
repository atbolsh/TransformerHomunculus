First order: (one, max two steps)
 Are you to the left or right of the gold?
 Which way do you need to turn to face the gold?
 Is the gold in front or behind you?
 Are you facing the gold? (interpreted as 'if you go forward will you eat it'
 
 Are you facing the blue line?
 Do you need to turn to face the blue line? Which way?
 
 Please step forward
 Step backward
 Turn right
 Turn left
 
 Turn towards the gold
 Turn away from the gold

 Are you near the gold? (for some function of near; choose this).

 Do you want to be in the second or first image? Which is preferable? (other versions of this; uses dopamine and language).
 
Requires visualization:
 Where were you in the last step?
 Where were you 5 steps ago, roughly?
 Imagine this room without you.
 Imagine this room without gold.
 Imagine this room empty.

Will require difficult loss funcs:
 Imagine if you were further away from the gold?
 Imagine if you were closer to the gold?

 Imagine if the gold were closer to the upper left corner of the game.

These will help when I get to corners:
 Imagine a line from you to the gold.
 Imagine what it would look like if you were facing the gold
 Imagine if you were halfway to the gold.


Second order:

 Please solve this game: turn towards the gold and eat it.
 Please tell me which of the gold pieces is closer
 Is this reconstruction better, or worse, than this one?
 Is this path better, or worse, than this one?

 Please imagine a piece of gold near the center of the board. Then, visualize a path.

Early plans (no more than 2 or 3 steps; longer waits for stored plans):
 Please take 2 steps forward, then repeat this phrase: "phrase".
 Please take 2 steps forward, then visualize the path from your old position to your new position.

NON-VERBAL:
** Train the dopamine session every time it reaches gold or not, or every time it can make choices.
 Teain recalll from past events (use text, I guess, but it's not really necessary).
