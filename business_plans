Once I quite my job, one day a week will be devoted to non-AI tasks.

Some of these are infrastructure ideas. See that file.

Others are related to the 'making a company and maybe getting money' side.

Tasks like:
 -- make a website
 -- look up 'founder groups' here and in Miami
 -- look up any events for startups; any local tech conferences
 -- any local 'hobbyist developer' groups
 -- file an LLC (probably Florida, but check options)
 -- think about stretching the money (make food at home; not exactly a business task)
 -- once I have something, think about making a good demo
 -- logo, pretty website
 -- X presence
 -- San Fran visit; find the Miami tech scene.
