Competes with training:
 -- debug why big server crashes with 2 training notebooks
 -- move all docs into new doc folder
 -- move all frameworks into new frameworks folder and make them work.

Independent of training:
 -- move everything important into new clearn git repo
 -- make proper 'framework' folder
 -- read up on SOTA
 -- try a framework or two (inference or training) on a new architecture, downloaded / pretrained
 -- try different training mechanisms for the frameworks. Check speeds and price
    -- check prices again, then maybe buy some top-of-the-line servers and swallow cost
 -- look up simple 3d envs. Try writing for one?
 -- look up lego robots and AI for lego robots (or other small robot platforms). Start building an env / machine? Play with simulators.
    -- focus on systems with prebuilt simulators / pretraining mechanisms
 -- business plans (see business_plans.md)

******
Main side project: new architecture!

As it is now, the memory is going to be a pain.
I really need a cascade of different memories, and / or memory to be stored within the current tokens (half-forgotten, with a time-stamp).

As I move on to phase 2 with the current beastie, I will also take time to rewrite that part, and retrain.

I will first start this sometime in July.
THis would also be a great excuse to buy more modern training hardware.

~~~~~~~~

Other points:
Memory may be an issue with the current iteration, but it won't be a fatal one.
I will take a week or two to focus on it with this one, maybe fix it, but mostly I will move on to phase 2 and learn to use the crutches (saved text and vector files).

The value of the current prototype is that it will have all of the 'animal' sides down, unfortunately likely without the long-term stuff.
