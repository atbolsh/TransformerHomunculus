At first, it looks like there are several areas of deliberate practice that could help me in this project:
 -- training networks (practice with small ones?)
 -- writing code (practice rewriting repo? Write twice?)
 -- practice writing frameworks

However, most of those either will already happen (rewriting the repo) or would waste too much time (practice training small networks).

I think the only possible exception: training memory.
THis can either happen while the frameworks are training, or separately from that project.
I have seen several papers on the subject (see the research doc).

Two main leads to pursue:
 -- R3Mem and other heirarchical stuff
 -- any video paper.
