Once I quite my job, one day a week will be devoted to non-AI tasks.

Some of these are infrastructure ideas. See that file.

Others are related to the 'making a company and maybe getting money' side.

Tasks like:
 -- make a website
 -- look up 'founder groups' here and in Miami
 -- look up any events for startups; any local tech conferences
 -- any local 'hobbyist developer' groups
 -- file an LLC (probably Florida, but check options)
 -- think about stretching the money (make food at home; not exactly a business task)
 -- once I have something, think about making a good demo
 -- logo, pretty website
 -- presence on X
 -- San Fran visit; find the Miami tech scene.
 -- get financial advisor?
 -- separate business bank account? Pay yourself a salary? Too complex?
 -- Decide when to buy the fancy new server.

Best chance is at conviction.com. Most especially, go for embed.conviction.com

Right now they're gearing for their spring session. Apply to the fall session once it's open (ESPECIALLY if you have enough to show).

Check on them once a month.

One day a week does not work with my discipline. I have planned a week in July; I may pull the trigger on this early (and leave more time for it later).

conviction.com is a cool place to start. So are other VCs. Start in Miami.

Plan: 
1) find Miami VCs; cold apply / cold DM.
2) Go to Base Club. Meet exciting ppl. Don't push your product, but have the demo ready.
3) ONce you have the website and some demos, develop a small online presence. DO NOT be obsessed with virality. Virality will come once the right person sees it.
   -- this is to have something concrete someone can look up, not to become famous online for no reason.
