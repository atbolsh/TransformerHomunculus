Research priorities are a little jumbled.

I have two main goals:
1) Understand the state of the industry and players
2) Look up cool models / concepts to steal.

For point 1, I will
a) watch a Sam ALtman video
b) Play with ChatGPT, Grok for a day (and maybe Claude)
c) Look up what Yann LeCun and Gary Marcus are doing; look up other big names and check recent publication
   -- see next day
d) Scroll through papers from recent conferences, download at least 2 or 3 here.
e) Read up on AutoGPT progress

~~~~~~~~

For point 2, I will

I)	Download Microsoft's Phi 4; play with it
II)	Find at least one more small language / multimodal model I like 
III)	Learn how to finetune Phi 4 and / or Florence 2
IV)	Look up / learn how to add parts to Phi 4 and / or Florence 2
V)	Read their accompanying blogs

~~~~~~~

Questions to answer:
 -- what is being done for multimodal agentic AI?
 -- what are the best examples of that?
 -- what are some of the best 'competitors' to the system I am making?
 -- What is OpenAI up to?
 -- look up that chart for when things should break (2026 or whatever). How does your progress measure up to doomsday?

~~~~~~~~

I refuse to sit down, make a new folder for the papers, read them all and summarize and seek a niche as before. Maybe for memory stuff, but that's it.
I will spend the upcoming trip, in the mornings, reading these papers, and writing a short summary for each.
Maybe in this document.

Once I'm back, THAT'S IT! Switch out of the academic sources. Focus on industry and on non-AI stuff (practical steps to set up a robot env with lego or other platform).

~~~~~~~~

Broader plan:
1) 1 or 2 papers a day for now.
2) Next week: Phi 4 and / or Florence, locally. Find ways to extend them. Find ways to finetune.
3) Industry sidequest
4) Look deep into 3d envs and / or robot interfaces. Make a purchase decision for Lego.

~~~~~~~~

Broader view: 
I want to do this for two reasons: 
a) understand the current market
q) borrow ideas

For the first all of these demos / papers are good

FOr the second, barring flashes of insight, I'll need to probe very very carefully. Or run tech demos on my own.
Here are some things, out of order, that I can do for this:
 -- make sure I can locally run Phi 4 and modify its architecture.
 -- run little tests, like trying a branch of the EnhancedBrain with a 512 character context.
 -- Deliberately look up papers with memory (old, new), including from my own library.
 -- Look up the GPT / Deepseek / other architectures again and see how they handle this issue.
