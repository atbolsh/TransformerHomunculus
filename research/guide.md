Research priorities are a little jumbled.

I have two main goals:
1) Understand the state of the industry and players
2) Look up cool models / concepts to steal.

For point 1, I will
a) watch a Sam ALtman video
b) Play with ChatGPT, Grok for a day (and maybe Claude)
c) Look up what Yann LeCun and Gary Marcus are doing; look up other big names and check recent publication
   -- see next day
d) Scroll through papers from recent conferences, download at least 2 or 3 here.
e) Read up on AutoGPT progress

~~~~~~~~

For point 2, I will

I)	Download Microsoft's Phi 4; play with it
II)	Find at least one more small language / multimodal model I like 
III)	Learn how to finetune Phi 4 and / or Florence 2
IV)	Look up / learn how to add parts to Phi 4 and / or Florence 2
V)	Read their accompanying blogs

~~~~~~~

Questions to answer:
 -- what is being done for multimodal agentic AI?
 -- what are the best examples of that?
 -- what are some of the best 'competitors' to the system I am making?
 -- What is OpenAI up to?
 -- look up that chart for when things should break (2026 or whatever). How does your progress measure up to doomsday?

I refuse to sit down, make a new folder for the papers, read them all and summarize and seek a niche as before. Maybe for memory stuff, but that's it.
I will spend the upcoming trip, in the mornings, reading these papers, and writing a short summary for each.
Maybe in this document.

Once I'm back, THAT'S IT! Switch out of the academic sources. Focus on industry and on non-AI stuff (practical steps to set up a robot env with lego or other platform).
