The big server is very very annoying to live with.

I need to put it into another room (with ethernet connection) and run it from there.

I will do whatever dad says for tunnels.

I may just get Elon's Starlink and use that for my wifi. I may even cancel Frontier; I will think about this.

I should get an external hard drive to keep backing up at least the brain weights, and possibly some other things (like image datasets).
 -- search through your tech junk heaps first, maybe pick an external terrabyte USB thing and use it as a backup (switching between the servers).
Cloud storage is an option, but a slow and possibly expensive one.

In a couple months, after several successful training sessions, I may get a professional, modern GPU training server. Budget 10k.

This year, GET WEBSITE.
Maybe also get LLC?

Short list:
 -- put server in other room, accessible online.
 -- get starlink
 -- get hard drive and backup routine
 -- get website
